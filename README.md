# C-Wi-Fi-Brute-Forcer
An active attack tool against Wi-Fi networks by using C.

This program is created to be a proof of concept that it is possible to write a working Wi-Fi attack tool with C since there are countless examples on the internet that claims to be legit hacking tools, working on CMD. While this tool does not claim a 100% success ratio, it still works if the target Wi-Fi has weak password. :)
# Usage
Open the exe if u don't have C compiler, Enter the SSid but first make sure that the password.txt and  Cbruteforcer.exe should be in the same folder, run it as an administrator.you can change the password.txt if u want to.
# Result
The password will be save in result.txt
